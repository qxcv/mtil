# List of tasks I want to complete

Going to add dates to each of these so that I can remove tasks if they get stale.

- Make MTGAIL work even when supplied batch size is not a multiple of supplied
  number of tasks (will have to change the batch size to be divisible by task
  count). **(2020-05-08)**
- Figure out why MTGAIL is so much slower than STGAIL & fix it (it's probably
  because of extra eval trajectories!). **(2020-05-08)**
- Implement some variant of "transfer GAIL" that trains the discriminator too.
  **(2020-05-08)**
- Figure out how I'm going to exploit differences between demonstrations & code
  that up. **(2020-05-08)**
